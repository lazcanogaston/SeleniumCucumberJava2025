# SeleniumCucumberJava2025
Base framework to start building an automation suite from your web.

Selected feature for automation:
Login functionality

Why? I consider this is an important feature to have automated and to be part of the regression.

Technologies used:
-Maven
-Java 17
-Selenium
-Cucumber
-JUnit
Dependencies management by Maven it is super clear and easy to use.
I selected the previous technologies because BDD is a trending methodology of testing due to the readability of the feature files. Anyone in the team can understand the scope of the test by just reading them.
Java and Selenium is wide use in the industry and have a big community working with them making the framework manteinable by me or any future Qa who joins the team.
Page object model as design pattern was chosen to avoid code duplication, improving the manteinability and the modulation of the code to respect the Single responsibility pattern.

REQUIREMENTS:

1- Have already installed:
    -Maven
    -Java
